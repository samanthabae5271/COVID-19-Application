# COVID-19-Application

This is a project I had worked on during my Junior Fall Semester in Database Management at Chapman University. 

Here I created an application that is capable of outputting any specified information the user wishes based on the datasets stored. The application is also capable of taking in additional datasets specified.

The user would follow the number choices and instructions to receive the desired output data with the following starting choices:
1) Print Record(s)
2) Search for Attribute
3) Add Record(s)
4) Update Record(s)
5) Delete Record(s)
6) Information of attributes
7) Input another dataset
8) Export table to csv
9) Rollback
10) Commit
11) Exit
